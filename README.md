Retail Store Machine Learning EDA Project Overview

Objective:
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail store data to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance, laying the groundwork for machine learning modeling.

Key Activities:

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Gathered retail store data including sales transactions, customer demographics, and product attributes.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed sales trends over time, identifying peak periods and seasonal patterns.
Explored customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and loyalty trends.
Investigated product categories, SKU performance, and pricing strategies.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features such as customer segmentation, purchase frequency, and average transaction value.
Derived insights from existing features like customer age, gender, and location.
Data Visualization:

Visualized EDA findings using charts, graphs, and dashboards.
Used tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create interactive visualizations.
Predictive Modeling Preparation:

Preprocessed data for machine learning modeling by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Identified potential target variables for regression or classification tasks.
Insights Generation:

Generated actionable insights to optimize store operations, marketing strategies, and inventory management.
Identified opportunities for revenue growth, customer retention, and cost reduction.
